## ohmyfood 

Ohmyfood is an online food ordering company. Our concept allows users to compose their own menu and reduce waiting time in restaurants because they make their choice in advance. No more wasting time consulting the menu!

This is the first phase of the web development for ohmyfood which contains 5 HTMLs ( Home Page and 4 Menu Pages ) and integrates sass methodologies.
